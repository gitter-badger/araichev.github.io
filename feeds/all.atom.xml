1) Make money the easiest way available to you, short of crime.
2) If you radically reduce your spending, you will not have to make as much money, and you might find that the sacrifices of low spending are more meaningful and empowering than the sacrifices of high earning.
3) The most valuable use of money, after basic survival, is to carve out a small space where you can pursue quality of life on your own terms.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Chapter 98.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maharaj&lt;/strong&gt;: Can you sit on the floor? Do you need a pillow? Have you any questions to ask? Not that you need to ask, you can as well be quiet. To be, just be, is important. You need not ask anything, nor do anything. Such apparently lazy way of spending time is highly regarded in India. It means that for the time being you are free from the obsession with 'what next'. When you are not in a hurry and the mind is free from anxieties, it becomes quiet and in the silence something may be heard which is ordinarily too fine and subtle for perception. The mind must be open and quiet to see. What we are trying to do here is to bring our minds into the right state for understanding what is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questioner&lt;/strong&gt;: How do we learn to cut out worries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: You need not worry about your worries. Just &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;. Do not try to be quiet. Do not make 'being quiet' into a task to be performed. Don't be restless about 'being quiet', miserable about 'being happy'.
Just be aware that you are and remain aware. Don't say, 'Yes, I am. What next?' There is no next in 'I am'. It is a timeless state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: If it is a timeless state, it will assert itself anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: You are what you are, timelessly, but of what use is it to you unless you know it and act on it? Your begging bowl may be of pure gold, but as long as you do not know it, you are a pauper. You must know your inner worth and trust it and express it in the daily sacrifice of desire and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: If I know myself, shall I not desire and fear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: For some time the mental habits may linger in spite of the new vision, the habit of longing for the
known past and fearing the unknown future. When you know these are of the mind only, you can go beyond them. As long as you have all sorts of ideas about yourself, you know yourself through the mist of these ideas.
To know yourself as you are, give up all ideas. You cannot imagine the taste of pure water, you can only discover it by abandoning all flavourings.
As long as you are interested in your present way of living, you will not abandon it. Discovery cannot come as long as you cling to the familiar. It is only when you realise fully the immense sorrow of your life and revolt against it, that a way out can be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: I can now see that the secret of India's eternal life lies in these dimensions of existence, of which India was always the custodian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: It is an open secret and there were always people willing and ready to share it. Teachers there are many, fearless disciples, very few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: I am quite willing to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Learning words is not enough. You may know the theory, but without the actual experience of yourself as the impersonal and unqualified centre of being, love and bliss, mere verbal knowledge is sterile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Then what am I to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Try to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;, only to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;. The all-important word is 'try'. Allot enough time daily for sitting quietly and trying, just trying, to go beyond the personality, with its addictions and obsessions. Don't ask how, it cannot be explained. You just keep on trying until you succeed. If you persevere, there can be no failure. What matters supremely is sincerity, earnestness; you must really have had surfeit of being the person you are, now see the urgent need of being free of this unnecessary self-identification with a bundle of memories and habits. This steady resistance against the unnecessary is the secret of success.
After all, you are what you are every moment of your life, but you are never conscious of it, except, maybe, at the point of awakening from sleep. All you need is to be aware of being, not as a verbal statement, but as an ever-present fact. The awareness that you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; will open your eyes to what you are.It is all very simple. First of all, establish a constant contact with your self, be with yourself all the time. Into self-awareness all blessings flow. Begin as a centre of observation, deliberate cognisance, and grow into a centre of love in action. 'I am' is a tiny seed which will grow into a mighty tree quite naturally, without a trace of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: I see so much evil in myself. Must I not change it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Evil is the shadow of inattention. In the light of self-awareness it will wither and fall off.
All dependence on another is futile, for what others can give, others will take away. Only what is your own at the start will remain your own in the end. Accept no guidance but from within, and even then sift out all memories for they will mislead you. Even if you are quite ignorant of the ways and the means, keep quiet and look within; guidance is sure to come. You are never left without knowing what your next step should be. The trouble is that you may shirk it. The guru is there for giving you courage because of his experience and success. But only what you discover through your own awareness, your own effort, will be of permanent use to you.
Remember, nothing you perceive is your own. Nothing of value can come to you from outside.
It is only your own feeling and understanding that are relevant and revealing. Words, heard or read, will only create images in your mind, but you are not a mental image. You are the power of perception and action behind and beyond the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: You seem to advise me to be self-centred to the point of egoism. Must I not yield even to my interest in other people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Your interest in others is egoistic, self-concerned, self-oriented. You are not interested in others as persons, but only as far as they enrich or ennoble your own image of yourself. And the ultimate
in selfishness is to care only for the protection, preservation and multiplication of one's own body. By &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; I mean all that is related to your name and shape: your family, tribe, country, race, etc. To be attached to one's name and shape is selfishness. A man who knows that he is neither body nor mind cannot be selfish, for he has nothing to be selfish for. Or, you may say, he is equally 'selfish' on behalf of everybody he meets.
Everybody's welfare is his own. The feeling 'I am the world, the world is myself' becomes quite natural. Once it is established, there is just no way of being selfish. To be selfish means to covet, acquire, accumulate on behalf of the part against the whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: One may be rich with many possessions, by inheritance, or marriage, or just good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: If you do not hold on to, it will be taken away from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: In your present state can you love another person as a person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: I am the other person, the other person is myself. In name and shape we are different, but there is no separation. At the root of our being we are one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Is it not so whenever there is love between people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: It is, but they are not conscious of it. They feel the attraction, but do not know the reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Why is love selective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Love is not selective, desire is selective. In love there are no strangers. When the centre of selfishness is no longer, all desires for pleasure and fear of pain cease; one is no longer interested in being happy; beyond happiness there is pure intensity, inexhaustible energy, the ecstasy of giving from a perennial source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Mustn't I begin by solving for myself the problem of right and wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: What is pleasant people take it to be good, and what is painful they take it to be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, that is how it is with us, ordinary people. But how is it with you, at the level of oneness? For you what is good and what is bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: What increases suffering is bad and what removes it is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: So you deny goodness to suffering itself. There are religions in which suffering is considered good and noble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Karma, or destiny, is an expression of a beneficial law: the universal trend towards balance, harmony and unity. At every moment, whatever happens now, is for the best. It may appear painful and ugly, a suffering bitter and meaningless, yet considering the past and the future it is for the
best, as the only way out of a disastrous situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Does one suffer only for one's own sins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: One suffers along with what one thinks oneself to be. If you feel one with humanity, you suffer with humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: And since you claim to be one with the sufferers, there is no limit in time or space to your suffering!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: To be is to suffer. The narrower the circle of my self-identification, the more acute the suffering caused by desire and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Christianity accepts suffering as purifying and ennobling, while Hinduism looks at it with distaste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Christianity is one way of putting words together and Hinduism is another. The real is behind and beyond words, incommunicable, directly experienced, explosive in its effect on the mind. It is easily had when nothing else is wanted. The unreal is created by imagination and perpetuated by desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Can there be no suffering that is necessary and good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Accidental or incidental pain is inevitable and transitory.
Deliberate pain, inflicted with even the best of intentions, is meaningless and cruel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: You would not punish crime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Punishment is but legalised crime. In a society built on prevention, rather than retaliation, there would be very little crime. The few exceptions, as of unsound mind and body, would be treated medically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: You seem to have little use for religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: What is religion? A cloud in the sky. I live in the sky, not in the clouds, which are so many words held together. Remove the verbiage and what remains? Truth remains. My home is in the
unchangeable, which appears to be a state of constant reconciliation and integration of opposites. People come here to learn about the actual existence of such a state, the obstacles to its emergence, and, once perceived, the art of stabilising it in consciousness, so that there is no clash between understanding and living. The state itself is beyond the mind and need not be learnt. The mind can only focus the obstacles.
Seeing an obstacle as an obstacle is effective, because it is the mind acting on the mind. Begin from the beginning: give attention to the fact that you are. At no time can you say 'I was not' all you can say is, 'I do not remember'. You know how unreliable memory is. Accept that, engrossed in petty personal affairs you have forgotten what you are.
Try to bring back the lost memory through the elimination of the known. You cannot be told what will happen, nor is it desirable.
Anticipation will create illusions. In the inner search the unexpected is inevitable.
The discovery is invariably beyond all imagination. Just as an unborn child cannot know life after birth, for it has nothing in its mind with which to form a valid picture, so is the mind unable to think of the real in terms of the unreal, except by negation: 'Not this, not that'. The acceptance of the unreal as real is the obstacle.
To see the false as false and abandon the false brings reality into being.
The states of utter clarity, immense love, utter fearlessness, these are mere words at the present, outlines without colour, hints at what can be. You are like a blind man expecting to see as a result of an operation, provided you do not shirk the operation! In the state that I am in, words do not matter at all.
Nor is there any addiction to words. Only facts matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: There can be no religion without words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Recorded religions are mere heaps of verbiage.
Religions show their true face in action, in silent action.
To know what a man believes, watch how he acts.
For most people, service of their bodies and their minds is their religion.
They may have religious ideas, but they do not act on them.
They play with them and are often very fond of them, but they will not act on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Words are needed for communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: For exchange of information, yes, but real communication between people is not verbal. For establishing and maintaining relationship, affectionate awareness expressed in direct action is required.
Not what you say, but what you do is that matters.
Words are made by the mind and are meaningful only on the level of the mind.
Take the word 'bread'.
You can neither eat it nor live by it.
It merely conveys an idea.
It acquires meaning only with the actual eating.
In the same sense I am telling you that the Normal State is not verbal.
I may say it is wise love expressed in action, but these words convey little, unless you experience them in their fullness and beauty.
Words have their limited usefulness, but we put no limits to them and bring ourselves to the brink of disaster.
Our noble ideas are finely balanced by ignoble actions.
We talk of God, Truth and Love, but instead of direct experience we have definitions.
Instead of enlarging and deepening action we chisel our definitions.
And we imagine that we know what we can define!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: How can one convey experience except through words?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Experience cannot be conveyed through words.
It comes with action.
A man who is intense in his experience will radiate confidence and courage.
Others too will act and gain experience born out of action.
Verbal teaching has its use, it prepares the mind for voiding itself of its accumulations.
A level of mental maturity is reached when nothing external is of any value and the heart is ready to relinquish all.
Then the real has a chance and it grasps it.
Delays, if any, are caused by the mind being unwilling to see or to discard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: Are we so totally alone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh, no, we are not.
Those who have, can give.
And such givers are many.
The world itself is a supreme gift, maintained by loving sacrifice.
But the right receivers, wise and humble, are so few.
'Ask and you shall be given' is the eternal law.
So many words you have learnt, so many you have spoken.
You know everything, but you do not know yourself.
For the self is not known through words.
Only direct insight will reveal it.
Look within, search within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: It is very difficult to abandon words.
Our mental life is one continuous stream of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: It is not a matter of easy or difficult.
You have no alternative.
Either you try or you don't. It is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: I have tried many times and failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Try again. If you keep on trying, something may happen. But if you don't, you are stuck. You may know all the right words, quote the scriptures, be brilliant in your discussions, and yet remain a bag of bones. Or you may be inconspicuous and humble, an insignificant person altogether, yet glowing with loving kindness and deep wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;But what is holistic?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What is the soul?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What arises from night?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What is history but an optical illusion&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;About every person we meet&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;See&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The foaming brook&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Without compunction&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Our problem in the whole movement of thought&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Must inevitably fall in its right place&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Wherever are forms with transparent boundaries&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Wherever are forms with transparent boundaries&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Wherever are outlets into celestial space&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Wherever is stillness and awe&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Caliph Ali is seeking after thee&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Therefore be at rest from seeking after thee&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Therefore be at rest from seeking after it&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This is the way you become free of debts&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;You will be found in the connexion p implies p&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And has no more than three&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Suggest to your mind some such possibility as this&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;That every proposition alters something in common&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Between a fact&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And an Infinite Space&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When you rise above your personality,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A Being above your personality,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A Being which is of great importance&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The use of the Universal Mind&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Is the explanation of the object itself&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Universal Mind is the totality of propositions&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And is based upon the Elements&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Given the composition of facts&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;To which objects are colourless&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Two objects of the objects&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Roughly speaking&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The groups of truth-conditions&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Are equal numbers of white and black&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;But to them that they are identical is nonsense&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And to all the general form is the sign&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Essential are those which alone and independently have a threefold  manifestation&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Three functions attributes or characteristics&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This and that and one&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Essential and subtle&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Law and Love&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;If you want to visit the Atomic Plane&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Esoteric meaning is always more or less vague&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;So every proposition is the same&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;But the possibility of every truth-operation on the mind and the proof&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Must show that there are places for arguments&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Of the probability Trs to Tr&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;So the measure of the human organism is your Being&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;That is all&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;But you may perceive some activity in the innermost depths&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Ghosts of earthbound spirits&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;No proposition can contradict it&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Identity in the world is also given&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This last is a Path that attempts to rediscover&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The symbol for the other&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Do not be disturbed by apparent irregularities&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Do not be disturbed by the marks of triangles and hexagons together&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A particle cannot at its root mean the same as (∃x).fx&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The determination is a sign&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Essential are those who find true peace&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And quiet and strength&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And renewal within the Causal Worlds&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And whether found ascending in the East&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Or descending in the West&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The plane is without stress&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;$13.34 earned by day labor&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;$36.78 in all&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Which subtracted from the same feeling that I can stand aloof from betimes their winter quarters who have lost their vitality,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And so frequently the most money demanded are never the worst vice betrayed&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Improvidence&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I sometimes dream of mine to ornament a line&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Of a march of crusaders in the shallower parts,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Floating up to feed, where else would they be?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Some absolute goodness somewhere?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;With such reminiscences I repeopled the woods&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And still from time to time&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Here are such that you have done great deeds and sung divine songs,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Which shall still consist of only one or two of my pleasing works&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I took up my clothes, and along and out of the water,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Full of glee and youth, as most suppose,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Drained,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Would not stand much about gracefulness,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And never mean to countenance an effort,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And never hesitated at a certain set of rules,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Called etiquette and politeness,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I made it worth the while&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;That economy of living is diminished in proportion to what we pay,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Though there are any such, as has been gradually converted into the Middlesex hive,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And that sometimes it was that man could not get on in the year take place only in youth,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;With round greasy face and paws,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Wearing a thick new garment to take charge of a dollar,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And having put on mourning in midsummer,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When I am convinced that I discovered&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;That it should as surely as so many violent blows without being domesticated,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Come floating up to feed,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And the fact that the remedy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; worse than the cure,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The blue angels in it,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;As the railroad, six feet square by seven deep,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Black melancholy in thought and in November,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Usually in a grass hut,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Listening to the last wrinkle which study had made,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And growing five or six feet beneath the rattling teams and chaises&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And tinkling sleighs that travel the ice, seen near at home,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I was plowing&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They warned me twice&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Once while I just let time wear on leaning against a low-land degeneracy,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Thinking how little this village does for its own conditions,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Changes, perhaps, from half an hour under a rotten stump,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;My hoe played the &lt;em&gt;Ranz des Vaches&lt;/em&gt; ,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A rich and various crop unreaped by man&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Mine was as it is&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Worse to have invented and established worship,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Then to let them see they slew or captured any monster,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Or finished any labor&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They have only one fact,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Or the three I have for farm produce&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Sold at $23.44&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We are in the beginning of a lull&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And I have had an emotional experience&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Very calmly and very quietly I say&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;All right&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Look at Gunsmoke&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Look at the proletariat&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The anarchy in production&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The crying inequalities in the modes of producing and appropriating products,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;That is bound to have an answer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Get a Bible&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Get others&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Get the money&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;That is the bourgeoisie&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Use their life&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Take their time and labor&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They smash to pieces machinery&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They set factories ablaze&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They seek to alter the character of production&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Therefore as the people who profess one thing&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;One social thing&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We go&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Because we take the name of God at the foot of the old property relations&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Not justified by faith&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;But cooking with gas now&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I say that's great&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I say that's great&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I say, Lady, if it's carried out in your place&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Dissolution going on before our television sets&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Spending our time filling the night before&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I saw an inscription coming up this mountain&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;To the unknown God&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Do You believe in Christ?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Have you really given yourself to Christ?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Do You believe in Him?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I can do!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;See Romans 6:20-23&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We take His name&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We write it down&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Manifesto has become fully developed&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A new life of the state of society&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And the heroes of modern American life?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Learn more by watching than by reading&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Why do you know what living was?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I follow God and that place where the workers begin to form combinations&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Trades' Unions&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Against the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a nuclear war&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;That could be a revolution&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;On the floor of the Law&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Administrative reforms based on class antagonisms be damned!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;No flesh be justified!&lt;/div&gt;

Google's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/downloads/detail?name=transitfeed-1.2.12.tar.gz&amp;amp;can=2&amp;amp;q="&gt;transitfeed package&lt;/a&gt; is designed to do this, but the latest version (1.2.12) has a bug in it which prevents the KML writer from being imported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching the web on the issue, i found Dylan Vassallo's Github repo &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dylanvee/pybcp47"&gt;pybcp47&lt;/a&gt;, which helped me create this patch to squash the bug: &lt;a class="reference external" href="/files/transitfeed-1.2.13_unofficial.tar.gz"&gt;transitfeed-1.2.13_unofficial.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the KML output online, i used &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://display-kml.appspot.com/"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I did so, because i don't need the dynamic Flask-application capabilities of Blohg and because Pelican is more mature and equally simple to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition was mostly smooth, but i did encounter a few issues that required me to search beyond Pelican's documentation to resolve.
To save new Pelicaneers the effort, here are those issues and resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Custom paginated templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted a separate landing page and blog page, and the Pelican docs don't elaborate on this point.
Querying the Pelican developers through the project's Github page, i received &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/735#issuecomment-17674540"&gt;instructions from justinmayer&lt;/a&gt;.
First, he said, i needed to make a custom template to house my blog, which i called &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;blog.html&lt;/tt&gt;.
It contains the code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{% extends &amp;quot;base.html&amp;quot; %}
{% set active_page = &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; %}
{% block title %}{{ SITENAME }} - Blog{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
{% for article in (articles_page.object_list if articles_page else articles) %}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;blogItem&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.url }}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ article.title }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {{ article.content }}

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;blogMeta&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Author: &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;mailto: {{ AUTHOR_EMAIL }}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ article.author }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Date: {{ article.locale_date }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {% if article.tags %}
        Tags:
        {% for tag in article.tags %}
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;{{ SITEURL }}/{{ tag.url }}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            {{ tag }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {% endif %}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.url }}#disqus_thread&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comments&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; -
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;{{ SITEURL }}/{{ article.url }}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Permalink&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- end #blogItem --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{% endfor %}
{% include &amp;#39;pagination.html&amp;#39; %}
{% endblock content %}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, here's the code for the pagination template &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pagination.html&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{% if articles_page and articles_paginator.num_pages &amp;gt; 1 %}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;pagination&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {% if articles_page.has_previous() %}
        {% set num = articles_page.previous_page_number() %}
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;prev&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;            {{ SITEURL }}/{{ page_name }}{{ num if num &amp;gt; 1 else &amp;#39;&amp;#39;}}.html&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ni"&gt;&amp;amp;laquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {% endif %}
    {% for num in range( 1, 1 + articles_paginator.num_pages ) %}
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;            {{ SITEURL }}/{{ page_name }}{{ num if num &amp;gt; 1 else &amp;#39;&amp;#39; }}.html&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;{{ &amp;#39;active&amp;#39; if num == articles_page.number else &amp;#39;&amp;#39; }}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ num }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {% endfor %}
    {% if articles_page.has_next() %}
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;next&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;            {{ SITEURL }}/{{ page_name }}{{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;               articles_page.next_page_number() }}.html&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ni"&gt;&amp;amp;raquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {% endif %}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{% endif %}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got it from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes"&gt;tuxlit_tbs Pelican theme&lt;/a&gt; and modified it to my liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, i had to add the following lines to my &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DIRECT_TEMPLATES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;index&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;blog&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;tags&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;categories&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;archives&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PAGINATED_DIRECT_TEMPLATES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;blog&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Disqus comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another topic the Pelican docs don't elaborate on.
To embed Disqus comments in my blog pages, i read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472097"&gt;Disqus's help article on embedding comments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/565624"&gt;Disqus's help article on adding comment counts&lt;/a&gt; and did the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, i made the template &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;disqus_comments.html&lt;/tt&gt; which contains the code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{% if DISQUS_SITENAME %}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;blogItem&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comments&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;disqus_thread&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_shortname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;{{ DISQUS_SITENAME }}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dsq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;http://&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_shortname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;.disqus.com/embed.js&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

             &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementsByTagName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;body&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dsq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Please enable JavaScript to view the

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{% endif %}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and in my &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;article.html&lt;/tt&gt; template added the line &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;{% include 'disqus_comments.html' %}&lt;/tt&gt; before the line &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;{% endblock %}&lt;/tt&gt;.
Doing so embeds Disqus comments for each blog post (article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, i made the template &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;disqus_comment_counts.html&lt;/tt&gt; which contains the code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{% if DISQUS_SITENAME %}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_shortname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;{{ DISQUS_SITENAME }}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;script&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;text/javascript&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;http://&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_shortname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;.disqus.com/count.js&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementsByTagName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;HEAD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementsByTagName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;BODY&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{% endif %}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and in my &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;base.html&lt;/tt&gt; template added the line &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;{% include 'disqus_comment_counts.html' %}&lt;/tt&gt; before the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tag.
That enables blog post comment counts via the tags &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;a &lt;span class="pre"&gt;href=&amp;quot;{{&lt;/span&gt; SITEURL &lt;span class="pre"&gt;}}/{{&lt;/span&gt; article.url &lt;span class="pre"&gt;}}#disqus_thread&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Comments&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Typesetting math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mathjax.org/"&gt;MathJax&lt;/a&gt; to typeset math on this site.
Pelican has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins"&gt;LaTeX plugin&lt;/a&gt;, which uses MathJax, but doesn't work properly at present.
It didn't typeset math in the list view of my blog posts, only in the detail view of each post.
So i searched the web for an alternative and found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~amic/blog/mathjax-and-pelican-en.html"&gt;this helpful blog post&lt;/a&gt; from another Pelican user.
Following its instructions, i added this Javascript code into the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; section of my &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;base.html&lt;/tt&gt; template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Using MathJax, with the delimiters $ --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Conflict with pygments for the .mo and .mi --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;text/x-mathjax-config&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MathJax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;HTML-CSS&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;.MathJax .mo, .MathJax .mi&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;black ! important&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tex2jax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;inlineMath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;$&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;$&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;\\(&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;\\)&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;processEscapes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MathJax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;StartupHook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;HTML-CSS Jax Ready&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;VARIANT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;italic&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fonts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unshift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;MathJax_SansSerif-italic&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;VARIANT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;-tex-mathit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fonts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unshift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;MathJax_SansSerif-italic&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;['$','$']&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; item which allows dollar signs to delimit math text, as is standard in LaTeX documents, but it requires escaping every backslash in the math text with an additional backslash.
For now i'll stick with the standard RST role &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;:math:&lt;/tt&gt; for inline math and the standard RST directive &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.. math::&lt;/tt&gt; for block math display.
The area of a circle is &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;span class="text"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = (&lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt; ⁄ 4)&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You receive a credit C at a local store and would like to buy two items. You first walk through the store and create a list L of all available items. From this list you would like to buy two items that add up to the entire value of the credit. The solution you provide will consist of the two integers indicating the positions of the items in your list (smaller number first). For instance, with C=100 and L={5,75,25} the solution is 2,3; with C=200 and L={150,24,79,50,88,345,3} the solution is 1,4; and with C=8 and L={2,1,9,4,4,56,90,3} the solution is 4,5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brute force. Test all pairs in the list. O(n^2) time and O(n) space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sort the list and then iterate over the list, at each step looking for the complementary price of the current price via binary search.
O(n lg n) time and O(n) space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-3"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Store the prices and indices in a dictionary and then iterate over the dictionary, at each step looking for the complementary price. Since dictionary look-up is constant time on average, this is an O(n) time (in the average case) and O(n) space algorithm.  Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a Python 2.7 implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;find_pair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;prices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Make a dictionary with items of the form&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# (price, set of indices of items with that price).&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Note that the price list could contain duplicate prices.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enumerate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Check whether there&amp;#39;s a complementary price in d.&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;credit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine recently pointed me to Spotify's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/jobs/tech/catvsdog/"&gt;Cat vs. Dog puzzle&lt;/a&gt;.
The question is long, and so i'll summarize it without its motivating context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are given n votes, each of which is a pair of strings of the form &lt;span class="formula"&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Ci&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dj&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 (a cat-lover vote) or &lt;span class="formula"&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Dj&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ci&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 (a dog-lover) for some integers &lt;span class="formula"&gt;1 ≤ &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; ≤ &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
.
This collection of votes can contain repeats.
Two votes &lt;span class="formula"&gt;(&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 and &lt;span class="formula"&gt;(&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 are said to conflict if &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 or &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
.
So a conflict can only occur between a cat-lover vote and a dog-lover vote.
Your job is to find the size of a maximal subcollection of the votes in which no two votes conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brute-force.
Run through all possible subcollections of votes and test each for conflicts.
Choose the biggest non-conflicting subcollection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure would take &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 time in the worst case, because there are &lt;span class="formula"&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 subcollections to check.
That's very slow.
Can we be more clever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, model the problem with a graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distinguish the votes by tagging each with a unique identifier, such as an integer between &lt;span class="formula"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
 and &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
.  This takes &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the following undirected graph &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
. Make each vote a vertex, and add the edge &lt;span class="formula"&gt;{&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 if &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 and &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 are conflicting votes. This takes &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 time.  Notice that &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 is bipartite, because every edge connects a cat-lover vote to a dog-lover vote and no vertex is both a cat-lover vote and a dog-lover vote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice that every maximal subset of nonconflicting votes is the complement of a minimum vertex cover for &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
.  So find the size &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 of a minimum vertex cover for &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 and return &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
.  Now, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_vertex_cover"&gt;finding the size of a minimum vertex cover in an arbitrary undirected graph is an NP-complete problem&lt;/a&gt;, and there's no known sub-exponential time way to do that.  However, our graph is bipartite, and so by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nig%27s_theorem_%28graph_theory%29"&gt;Koenig's theorem&lt;/a&gt;, the size of a minimum vertex cover of &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 equals the size of a maximum matching for &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
, the latter of which can be found by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm"&gt;Hopcroft-Karp algorithm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;(|&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;|&lt;span class="sqrt"&gt;&lt;span class="radical"&gt;√&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="root"&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 time, where &lt;span class="formula"&gt;|&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
 is the number of edges in &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
.  In the worst case, &lt;span class="formula"&gt;|&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;| = &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 and running Hopcroft-Karp takes &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all up, Algorithm 2 takes &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 time in the worst case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://programmingpraxis.com/2013/03/22/jumping-jack/"&gt;March 22, 2013 Programming Praxis puzzle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack starts at 0 on the number line and jumps one unit in either direction. Each successive jump he makes is longer than the previous by 1 unit, and can be made in either direction.
Design an algorithm that takes an integer n and returns a shortest sequence of jumps that Jack can perform to reach n along with the length of that sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brute-force.
Perform a breadth-first search through the binary tree of all valid jump/integer summand sequences (0, -1, 1, -1 - 2, -1 + 2, 1 - 2, 1 + 2, ...) and stop when the target sum n is reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brute-force with pruning.
Label the nodes of the binary tree with their partial sums and order the nodes of so that the left child is less than the right child (0, -1, 1, -3, -1, -1, 3, ...).
Notice that every pair of nodes at the same height with equal partial sums have equal subtrees.
Notice also that every pair of nodes at the same height with partial sums of opposite sign have mirror image subtrees.
Notice also that flipping the signs/turns of a path with partial sum s yields a path of the same length to -s.
So in our breadth-first search, we don't need to search down a node at a given height if we've already discovered a node at the same height with the same magnitude partial sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the worst-case time complexity of Algorithm 1 or Algorithm 2 requires knowing at what tree height the given number n is first discovered.
If you can figure that out, then you probably discovered...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-3"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart-force.
Find the least integer k such that t_k := 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k &amp;gt;= |n| and t_k has the same parity (evenness/oddness) as |n|.
Then flip the signs of the summands of t_k in a systematic way to total n.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the details.
Notice that t_k = k(k + 1)/2, a triangular number.
Setting t_k = |n| and solving for k gives the ceiling of (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 |n|))/2.
So k equals the ceiling or 1 or 2 plus it, whichever of those three numbers has the same parity as n and is least.
Here we're using the fact that the set {t, t + s, t + s + (s + 1)} of three consecutive triangular numbers contains both even and odd numbers for any positive integers t, s.
(Simply check all four parity possibilities for t, s.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find a minimal length sum for n, first compute d := (t_k - n)/2.
Because t_k &amp;gt;= |n| and t_k and n have the same parity, d lies in the set {0, 1, 2, ..., t_k}.
Now repeatedly subtract: d = a_k (k) + r_k, r_k = a_{k-1} (k-1) + r_{k-1}, ..., r_2 = a_1 (1) + r_1, choosing each a_i maximally in {0, 1}.
By the lemma below,  r_1 = 0.
So d = sum_{i=1}^k a_i i.
Thus n = t_k - 2d = sum_{i=1}^k i - sum_{i=1}^k 2a_i i = sum_{i=1}^k (1 - 2a_i) i and 1 - 2a_i in {-1, 1}.
So the sequence b_i := 1 - 2a_i is a path, and by the minimality of k, b_i is a minimal path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-3-example"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 3 example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the target number n=12.
According to Algorithm 3, the possibilities for k are 5, 6, 7.
The corresponding values of t_k are 15, 21, and 28.
Since 28 is the least of these with the same parity as n, we see that k=7.
So d = (t_k - n)/2 = 8, which we write as 1 + 7 according to the algorithm.
Thus a shortest path to 12 is -1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 - 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; shortest path, because shortest paths aren't unique in general.
For example, 1 + 2 -3 + 4 - 5 + 6 + 7 also works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-3-correctness"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 3 correctness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lemma&lt;/em&gt;: Let A_k = {0, 1, 2, ..., t_k}.
Then a number lies in A_k if and only if it can be expressed as a sum sum_{i=1}^k a_i i for some a_i in {0, 1}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof&lt;/em&gt;: By induction on k.
First, 0 = sum_{i=1}^0 1, the empty sum.
Now suppose the result holds for all k - 1 &amp;gt;= 0 and let d in A_k.
Repeatedly subtract: d = a_k (k) + r_k, r_k = a_{k-1} (k-1) + r_{k-1}, ..., choosing each a_i maximally in {0, 1} and stopping at the first r_j in A_j for some j &amp;lt; k.
Then by the induction hypothesis, r_j = sum_{i=0}^j b_i i for some b_i in {0, 1}.
Then d = r_j + sum_{i=j+1}^k a_k i, as desired.
Conversely, a sum s := sum_{i=1}^k a_i i for a_i in {0, 1} satisfies 0 &amp;lt;= s &amp;lt;= sum_{i=1}^k i = t_k, and so s in A_k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="algorithm-3-time-complexity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Algorithm 3 time complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that arithmetic operations are constant time, it takes O(1) time to compute k from n, and hence the length of a minimal path to n.
Then it takes O(k) time to find a minimal length sum for d and O(k) time to use that sum to produce a minimal length sum for n.
So O(k) = O(sqrt(n)) time all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

What gross hourly income must you earn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, i used the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ird.govt.nz/how-to/taxrates-codes/itaxsalaryandwage-incometaxrates.html"&gt;1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 NZ income tax rates for individuals&lt;/a&gt;, wrote &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/araichev/hourly_wage"&gt;this Python program&lt;/a&gt;, and used it with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sagemath.org"&gt;Sage&lt;/a&gt; to make this table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;object data="/files/hourly_wage.svg" style="width: 650px;" type="image/svg+xml"&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gross hourly incomes needed are displayed in the main body of the table in New Zealand dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar and excluding GST.
For example, to earn $1200/week after tax, working 25 hours/week, you need to earn $68/hour before tax.&lt;/p&gt;

It also includes a bunch of other useful scientific modules, such as the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and Basemap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second easiest way is to follow &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10183144/installing-build-matplotlib-in-mac-osx-lion"&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; at StackOverflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both approaches worked for me.
In the end, i chose the Enthought distribution, because it includes more modules.&lt;/p&gt;

She told Achaan Chah she could stay only a short time, as she had to return to take care of her great grandchildren, and since she was an old lady, she asked if he could please give her a brief Dharma talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He replied with great force, &amp;quot;Hey, listen. There's no one here, just this. No owner, no one to be old, to be young, to be good or bad, weak or strong. Just this, that's all; various elements of nature playing themselves out, all empty. No one born and no one to die. Those who speak of death are speaking the language of ignorant children. In the language of the heart, of Dharma, there's no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When we carry a burden, it's heavy. When there's no one to carry it, there's not a problem in the world. Do not look for good or bad or for anything at all. Do not be anything. There's nothing more; just this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;None know if our deaths are now or forever:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is the servant of the Living God duly and daily serving him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his prayer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he rolls upon prank to work it in.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For this he performs in ten degrees.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are clean.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws extended.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For fifthly he washes himself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For sixthly he rolls upon wash.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon the beat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For eighthly he rubs himself against a post.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For ninthly he looks up for his instructions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For tenthly he goes in quest of food.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For having consider’d God and himself he will consider his neighbour.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a chance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For when his day’s work is done his business more properly begins.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he keeps the Lord’s watch in the night against the adversary.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is of the tribe of Tiger.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For the Cherub Cat is a term of the Angel Tiger.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent, which in goodness he suppresses.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he will not do destruction, if he is well-fed, neither will he spit without provocation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he purrs in thankfulness, when God tells him he’s a good Cat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For every house is incomplete without him and a blessing is lacking in the spirit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For the Lord commanded Moses concerning the cats at the departure of the Children of Israel from Egypt.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For every family had one cat at least in the bag.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For the English Cats are the best in Europe.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of God to him exceedingly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is the quickest to his mark of any creature.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is tenacious of his point.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is a mixture of gravity and waggery.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he knows that God is his Saviour.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is of the Lord’s poor and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually—Poor Jeoffry! poor Jeoffry! the rat has bit thy throat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For I bless the name of the Lord Jesus that Jeoffry is better.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete cat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in music.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is docile and can learn certain things.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he can set up with gravity which is patience upon approbation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he can fetch and carry, which is patience in employment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he can jump over a stick which is patience upon proof positive.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he can jump from an eminence into his master’s bosom.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he can catch the cork and toss it again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For the former is afraid of detection.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For the latter refuses the charge.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he killed the Ichneumon-rat very pernicious by land.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For his ears are so acute that they sting again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For by stroking of him I have found out electricity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For I perceived God’s light about him both wax and fire.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For the Electrical fire is the spiritual substance, which God sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For, tho he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadruped.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he can tread to all the measures upon the music.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he can swim for life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For he can creep.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;~ Christopher Smart, excerpt from 'Jubilate Agno', published in 1939 but written around 1760!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;I wish nothing else but to speak simply&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;please grant me this privilege&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;because we have burdened our song with so much music&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;that it is slowly sinking&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;and our art has become so ornate&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;that the makeup has corroded her face&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;and it is time to say our few simple words&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;because tomorrow our soul sails away&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Translated by Christos Papadimitriou from the Greek original:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Δε θέλω τίποτε άλλο παρά να μιλήσω απλά,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;να μου δοθεί ετούτη η χάρη.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Γιατί και το τραγούδι το φορτώσαμε με τόσες μουσικές&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;που σιγά σιγά βουλιάζει.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Και την τέχνη μας τη στολίσαμε τόσο πολύ&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;που φαγώθηκε απ’ τα μαλάματα το πρόσωπό της.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Κι είναι καιρός να πούμε τα λιγοστά μας λόγια&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;γιατί η ψυχή μας αύριο κάνει πανιά&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I met a traveller from an antique land&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Stand in the desert… Near them, on the sand,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Tell that its sculptor well those passions read&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And on the pedestal these words appear:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Nothing beside remains. Round the decay&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The lone and level sands stretch far away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Oh, to love what is lovely, and will not last!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What a task&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;to ask&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;of anything, or anyone,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;yet it is ours,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;and not by the century or the year, but by the hours.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;One fall day I heard&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;above me, and above the sting of the wind, a sound&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I did not know, and my look shot upward; it was&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;a flock of snow geese, winging it&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;faster than the ones we usually see,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;and, being the color of snow, catching the sun&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;so they were, in part at least, golden. I&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;held my breath&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;as we do&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;sometimes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;to stop time&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;when something wonderful&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;has touched us&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;as with a match,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;which is lit, and bright,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;but does not hurt&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;in the common way,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;but delightfully,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;as if delight&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;were the most serious thing&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;you ever felt.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The geese&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;flew on,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I have never seen them again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Maybe I will, someday, somewhere.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Maybe I won’t.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It doesn’t matter.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What matters&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;is that, when I saw them,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I saw them&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;as through the veil, secretly, joyfully, clearly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Well they’d made up their minds to be everywhere because why not.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Everywhere was theirs because they thought so.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They with two leaves they whom the birds despise.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In the middle of stones they made up their minds.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They started to cut.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Well they’d made up their minds to be everywhere because why not.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;In the middle of stones they made up their minds.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They started to cut.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Well they cut everything because why not.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Everything was theirs because they thought so.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It fell into its shadows and they took both away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Some to have some for burning.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Well cutting everything they came to water.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They came to the end of the day there was one left standing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They would cut it tomorrow they went away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The night gathered in the last branches.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The shadow of the night gathered in the shadow on the water.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The night and the shadow put on the same head.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And it said Now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Well in the morning they cut the last one.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Like the others the last one fell into its shadow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It fell into its shadow on the water.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They took it away its shadow stayed on the water.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Well they shrugged they started trying to get the shadow away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They cut right to the ground the shadow stayed whole.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They laid boards on it the shadow came out on top.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They shone lights on it the shadow got blacker and clearer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They exploded the water the shadow rocked.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They built a huge fire on the roots.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They sent up black smoke between the shadow and the sun.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The new shadow flowed without changing the old one.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They shrugged they went away to get stones.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They came back the shadow was growing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They started setting up stones it was growing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They looked the other way it went on growing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They decided they would make a stone out of it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They took stones to the water they poured them into the shadow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They poured them in they poured them in the stones vanished.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The shadow was not filled it went on growing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;That was one day.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The next day was just the same it went on growing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They did all the same things it was just the same.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They decided to take its water from under it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They took away water they took it away the water went down.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The shadow stayed where it was before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It went on growing it grew onto the land.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They started to scrape the shadow with machines.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When it touched the machines it stayed on them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They started to beat the shadow with sticks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Where it touched the sticks it stayed on them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They started to beat the shadow with hands.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Where it touched the hands it stayed on them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;That was another day.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Well the next day started about the same it went on growing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They pushed lights into the shadow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Where the shadow got onto them they went out.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They began to stomp on the edge it got their feet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And when it got their feet they fell down.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It got into eyes the eyes went blind.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The ones that fell down it grew over and they vanished.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The ones that went blind and walked into it vanished.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The ones that could see and stood still&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It swallowed their shadows.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Then it swallowed them too and they vanished.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Well the others ran.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The ones that were left went away to live if it would let them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They went as far as they could.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The lucky ones with their shadows.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Thursday&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I have had my dream --like others--&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As i understand it, all USA citizens are required under USA law to report their worldwide income annually on a USA tax return, if they owe USA taxes.
See the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://newzealand.usembassy.gov/irs.html"&gt;USA Embassy website&lt;/a&gt; for more details.
If i'm wrong on this, then please let me know, because it'll save me some time :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how i, a non-accountant, prepare my tax return.
The procedure has worked for me for the past 4 years with no complaints from the USA Internal Revenue Service.
If your finances aren't that complicated, it might work for you too.
No promises, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="april"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15 April&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact the NZ Internal Revenue Department (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ird.govt.nz/"&gt;http://www.ird.govt.nz/&lt;/a&gt;) and ask them to mail you a Summary of Earnings for the past fiscal year.
The NZ fiscal tax year is 1 April--31 March.
Summary of Earnings letters usually arrive in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16 April&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.irs.gov"&gt;IRS website&lt;/a&gt; and see if you need to complete an FBAR form to report your foreign bank accounts.
You probably do if you have had a total of USD 10000 in your foreign bank accounts at any point in the previous calendar year.
The FBAR is a new form (since 2012?) that carries a hefty fine for incompletion.
If you need to fill out an FBAR, then do it and mail it in.
In 2012 it was due separate from one's tax return on 30 June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="july"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15 July&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you receive your Summary of Earnings from NZ IRD, download the the following USA tax forms from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.irs.gov"&gt;IRS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;f1040: U.S. Individual Income Tax Return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;f1040sa: Schedule A Itemized Deductions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;f1116: Foreign Tax Credit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;f6251: Alternative Minimum Tax—Individuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;f4868: Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id3"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16 July&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill out the forms in this order, though some switching between forms is unavoidable: f1040sa, f1116, f1040, f6251, f4868.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For f1040sa, deduct nothing so that your itemized deductions total $0.
This odd step allows you to maximize your foreign tax credit in f1116, assuming that you did not earn any money in the USA.
If you did earn money in the USA, then depending on how much, you might benefit from &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; filling out f104sa and taking the standard deduction on f1040 instead.
Run the numbers yourself to check which option saves you more money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For f1116, get the NZ dollar-US dollar tax exchange rate for your tax year from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://newzealand.usembassy.gov/irs.html"&gt;http://newzealand.usembassy.gov/irs.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For f1040, enter 1 April--31 March as your tax year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id4"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;17 July&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print, double-check, and sign the forms.
Mail them to the IRS.
Celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
