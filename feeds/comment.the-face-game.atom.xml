The duality of Trust and or provide .. to what length do we play in the game.
Equal numbers are neither white nor black, it is all One.. &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; or not .. Even personality is the One risen above or not.. Universal expression in doing and in non doing, having and not having..
the only difference is anguish and not anguish.. pain or acceptance.. Love without needing..
But still the path shows itself clear and blurs along or not even along but in being Here and Now.. and when Caught up in There or Then to awaken again to reality.. and find it is all right and it is only ever Now. Caught by the colours or seeing through the illusions gives space but wit hin the game we must still play the part expressed for it is the universe fragmented as 'you'. here and now for only one reason .. to experience form and play the game of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
