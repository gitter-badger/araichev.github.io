    <h1><a href="http://raichev.net/freedom-from-self-identification.html">Freedom from Self-Identification</a></h1>
    <div class="date">2014-06-08</div>
    <p>This is one of my favorite chapters from <em>I am That</em> by Nisargadatta Maharaj,
Chapter 98.</p>
<p><strong>Maharaj</strong>: Can you sit on the floor? Do you need a pillow? Have you any questions to ask? Not that you need to ask, you can as well be quiet. To be, just be, is important. You need not ask anything, nor do anything. Such apparently lazy way of spending time is highly regarded in India. It means that for the time being you are free from the obsession with 'what next'. When you are not in a hurry and the mind is free from anxieties, it becomes quiet and in the silence something may be heard which is ordinarily too fine and subtle for perception. The mind must be open and quiet to see. What we are trying to do here is to bring our minds into the right state for understanding what is real.</p>
<p><strong>Questioner</strong>: How do we learn to cut out worries?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: You need not worry about your worries. Just <em>be</em>. Do not try to be quiet. Do not make 'being quiet' into a task to be performed. Don't be restless about 'being quiet', miserable about 'being happy'.
Just be aware that you are and remain aware. Don't say, 'Yes, I am. What next?' There is no next in 'I am'. It is a timeless state.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: If it is a timeless state, it will assert itself anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: You are what you are, timelessly, but of what use is it to you unless you know it and act on it? Your begging bowl may be of pure gold, but as long as you do not know it, you are a pauper. You must know your inner worth and trust it and express it in the daily sacrifice of desire and fear.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: If I know myself, shall I not desire and fear?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: For some time the mental habits may linger in spite of the new vision, the habit of longing for the
known past and fearing the unknown future. When you know these are of the mind only, you can go beyond them. As long as you have all sorts of ideas about yourself, you know yourself through the mist of these ideas.
To know yourself as you are, give up all ideas. You cannot imagine the taste of pure water, you can only discover it by abandoning all flavourings.
As long as you are interested in your present way of living, you will not abandon it. Discovery cannot come as long as you cling to the familiar. It is only when you realise fully the immense sorrow of your life and revolt against it, that a way out can be found.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: I can now see that the secret of India's eternal life lies in these dimensions of existence, of which India was always the custodian.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: It is an open secret and there were always people willing and ready to share it. Teachers there are many, fearless disciples, very few.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: I am quite willing to learn.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Learning words is not enough. You may know the theory, but without the actual experience of yourself as the impersonal and unqualified centre of being, love and bliss, mere verbal knowledge is sterile.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Then what am I to do?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Try to <em>be</em>, only to <em>be</em>. The all-important word is 'try'. Allot enough time daily for sitting quietly and trying, just trying, to go beyond the personality, with its addictions and obsessions. Don't ask how, it cannot be explained. You just keep on trying until you succeed. If you persevere, there can be no failure. What matters supremely is sincerity, earnestness; you must really have had surfeit of being the person you are, now see the urgent need of being free of this unnecessary self-identification with a bundle of memories and habits. This steady resistance against the unnecessary is the secret of success.
After all, you are what you are every moment of your life, but you are never conscious of it, except, maybe, at the point of awakening from sleep. All you need is to be aware of being, not as a verbal statement, but as an ever-present fact. The awareness that you <em>are</em> will open your eyes to what you are.It is all very simple. First of all, establish a constant contact with your self, be with yourself all the time. Into self-awareness all blessings flow. Begin as a centre of observation, deliberate cognisance, and grow into a centre of love in action. 'I am' is a tiny seed which will grow into a mighty tree quite naturally, without a trace of effort.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: I see so much evil in myself. Must I not change it?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Evil is the shadow of inattention. In the light of self-awareness it will wither and fall off.
All dependence on another is futile, for what others can give, others will take away. Only what is your own at the start will remain your own in the end. Accept no guidance but from within, and even then sift out all memories for they will mislead you. Even if you are quite ignorant of the ways and the means, keep quiet and look within; guidance is sure to come. You are never left without knowing what your next step should be. The trouble is that you may shirk it. The guru is there for giving you courage because of his experience and success. But only what you discover through your own awareness, your own effort, will be of permanent use to you.
Remember, nothing you perceive is your own. Nothing of value can come to you from outside.
It is only your own feeling and understanding that are relevant and revealing. Words, heard or read, will only create images in your mind, but you are not a mental image. You are the power of perception and action behind and beyond the image.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: You seem to advise me to be self-centred to the point of egoism. Must I not yield even to my interest in other people?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Your interest in others is egoistic, self-concerned, self-oriented. You are not interested in others as persons, but only as far as they enrich or ennoble your own image of yourself. And the ultimate
in selfishness is to care only for the protection, preservation and multiplication of one's own body. By <em>body</em> I mean all that is related to your name and shape: your family, tribe, country, race, etc. To be attached to one's name and shape is selfishness. A man who knows that he is neither body nor mind cannot be selfish, for he has nothing to be selfish for. Or, you may say, he is equally 'selfish' on behalf of everybody he meets.
Everybody's welfare is his own. The feeling 'I am the world, the world is myself' becomes quite natural. Once it is established, there is just no way of being selfish. To be selfish means to covet, acquire, accumulate on behalf of the part against the whole.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: One may be rich with many possessions, by inheritance, or marriage, or just good luck.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: If you do not hold on to, it will be taken away from you.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: In your present state can you love another person as a person?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: I am the other person, the other person is myself. In name and shape we are different, but there is no separation. At the root of our being we are one.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Is it not so whenever there is love between people?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: It is, but they are not conscious of it. They feel the attraction, but do not know the reason.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why is love selective?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Love is not selective, desire is selective. In love there are no strangers. When the centre of selfishness is no longer, all desires for pleasure and fear of pain cease; one is no longer interested in being happy; beyond happiness there is pure intensity, inexhaustible energy, the ecstasy of giving from a perennial source.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Mustn't I begin by solving for myself the problem of right and wrong?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: What is pleasant people take it to be good, and what is painful they take it to be bad.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Yes, that is how it is with us, ordinary people. But how is it with you, at the level of oneness? For you what is good and what is bad?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: What increases suffering is bad and what removes it is good.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: So you deny goodness to suffering itself. There are religions in which suffering is considered good and noble.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Karma, or destiny, is an expression of a beneficial law: the universal trend towards balance, harmony and unity. At every moment, whatever happens now, is for the best. It may appear painful and ugly, a suffering bitter and meaningless, yet considering the past and the future it is for the
best, as the only way out of a disastrous situation.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Does one suffer only for one's own sins?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: One suffers along with what one thinks oneself to be. If you feel one with humanity, you suffer with humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: And since you claim to be one with the sufferers, there is no limit in time or space to your suffering!</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: To be is to suffer. The narrower the circle of my self-identification, the more acute the suffering caused by desire and fear.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Christianity accepts suffering as purifying and ennobling, while Hinduism looks at it with distaste.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Christianity is one way of putting words together and Hinduism is another. The real is behind and beyond words, incommunicable, directly experienced, explosive in its effect on the mind. It is easily had when nothing else is wanted. The unreal is created by imagination and perpetuated by desire.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Can there be no suffering that is necessary and good?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Accidental or incidental pain is inevitable and transitory.
Deliberate pain, inflicted with even the best of intentions, is meaningless and cruel.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: You would not punish crime?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Punishment is but legalised crime. In a society built on prevention, rather than retaliation, there would be very little crime. The few exceptions, as of unsound mind and body, would be treated medically.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: You seem to have little use for religion.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: What is religion? A cloud in the sky. I live in the sky, not in the clouds, which are so many words held together. Remove the verbiage and what remains? Truth remains. My home is in the
unchangeable, which appears to be a state of constant reconciliation and integration of opposites. People come here to learn about the actual existence of such a state, the obstacles to its emergence, and, once perceived, the art of stabilising it in consciousness, so that there is no clash between understanding and living. The state itself is beyond the mind and need not be learnt. The mind can only focus the obstacles.
Seeing an obstacle as an obstacle is effective, because it is the mind acting on the mind. Begin from the beginning: give attention to the fact that you are. At no time can you say 'I was not' all you can say is, 'I do not remember'. You know how unreliable memory is. Accept that, engrossed in petty personal affairs you have forgotten what you are.
Try to bring back the lost memory through the elimination of the known. You cannot be told what will happen, nor is it desirable.
Anticipation will create illusions. In the inner search the unexpected is inevitable.
The discovery is invariably beyond all imagination. Just as an unborn child cannot know life after birth, for it has nothing in its mind with which to form a valid picture, so is the mind unable to think of the real in terms of the unreal, except by negation: 'Not this, not that'. The acceptance of the unreal as real is the obstacle.
To see the false as false and abandon the false brings reality into being.
The states of utter clarity, immense love, utter fearlessness, these are mere words at the present, outlines without colour, hints at what can be. You are like a blind man expecting to see as a result of an operation, provided you do not shirk the operation! In the state that I am in, words do not matter at all.
Nor is there any addiction to words. Only facts matter.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: There can be no religion without words.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Recorded religions are mere heaps of verbiage.
Religions show their true face in action, in silent action.
To know what a man believes, watch how he acts.
For most people, service of their bodies and their minds is their religion.
They may have religious ideas, but they do not act on them.
They play with them and are often very fond of them, but they will not act on them.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Words are needed for communication.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: For exchange of information, yes, but real communication between people is not verbal. For establishing and maintaining relationship, affectionate awareness expressed in direct action is required.
Not what you say, but what you do is that matters.
Words are made by the mind and are meaningful only on the level of the mind.
Take the word 'bread'.
You can neither eat it nor live by it.
It merely conveys an idea.
It acquires meaning only with the actual eating.
In the same sense I am telling you that the Normal State is not verbal.
I may say it is wise love expressed in action, but these words convey little, unless you experience them in their fullness and beauty.
Words have their limited usefulness, but we put no limits to them and bring ourselves to the brink of disaster.
Our noble ideas are finely balanced by ignoble actions.
We talk of God, Truth and Love, but instead of direct experience we have definitions.
Instead of enlarging and deepening action we chisel our definitions.
And we imagine that we know what we can define!</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: How can one convey experience except through words?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Experience cannot be conveyed through words.
It comes with action.
A man who is intense in his experience will radiate confidence and courage.
Others too will act and gain experience born out of action.
Verbal teaching has its use, it prepares the mind for voiding itself of its accumulations.
A level of mental maturity is reached when nothing external is of any value and the heart is ready to relinquish all.
Then the real has a chance and it grasps it.
Delays, if any, are caused by the mind being unwilling to see or to discard.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Are we so totally alone?</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Oh, no, we are not.
Those who have, can give.
And such givers are many.
The world itself is a supreme gift, maintained by loving sacrifice.
But the right receivers, wise and humble, are so few.
'Ask and you shall be given' is the eternal law.
So many words you have learnt, so many you have spoken.
You know everything, but you do not know yourself.
For the self is not known through words.
Only direct insight will reveal it.
Look within, search within.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: It is very difficult to abandon words.
Our mental life is one continuous stream of words.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: It is not a matter of easy or difficult.
You have no alternative.
Either you try or you don't. It is up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: I have tried many times and failed.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>: Try again. If you keep on trying, something may happen. But if you don't, you are stuck. You may know all the right words, quote the scriptures, be brilliant in your discussions, and yet remain a bag of bones. Or you may be inconspicuous and humble, an insignificant person altogether, yet glowing with loving kindness and deep wisdom.</p>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">This is the way you become free of debts</div>
<div class="line">You will be found in the connexion p implies p</div>
<div class="line">And has no more than three</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Suggest to your mind some such possibility as this</div>
<div class="line">That every proposition alters something in common</div>
<div class="line">Between a fact</div>
<div class="line">And an Infinite Space</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">When you rise above your personality,</div>
<div class="line">A Being above your personality,</div>
<div class="line">A Being which is of great importance</div>
<div class="line">The use of the Universal Mind</div>
<div class="line">Is the explanation of the object itself</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">The Universal Mind is the totality of propositions</div>
<div class="line">And is based upon the Elements</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Given the composition of facts</div>
<div class="line">To which objects are colourless</div>
<div class="line">Two objects of the objects</div>
<div class="line">Roughly speaking</div>
<div class="line">The groups of truth-conditions</div>
<div class="line">Are equal numbers of white and black</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">But to them that they are identical is nonsense</div>
<div class="line">And to all the general form is the sign</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Essential are those which alone and independently have a threefold  manifestation</div>
<div class="line">Three functions attributes or characteristics</div>
<div class="line">This and that and one</div>
<div class="line">Essential and subtle</div>
<div class="line">Law and Love</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">If you want to visit the Atomic Plane</div>
<div class="line">Esoteric meaning is always more or less vague</div>
<div class="line">So every proposition is the same</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">But the possibility of every truth-operation on the mind and the proof</div>
<div class="line">Must show that there are places for arguments</div>
<div class="line">Of the probability Trs to Tr</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">So the measure of the human organism is your Being</div>
<div class="line">That is all</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">But you may perceive some activity in the innermost depths</div>
<div class="line">Ghosts of earthbound spirits</div>
<div class="line">No proposition can contradict it</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Identity in the world is also given</div>
<div class="line">This last is a Path that attempts to rediscover</div>
<div class="line">The symbol for the other</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Do not be disturbed by apparent irregularities</div>
<div class="line">Do not be disturbed by the marks of triangles and hexagons together</div>
<div class="line">A particle cannot at its root mean the same as (∃x).fx</div>
<div class="line">The determination is a sign</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Essential are those who find true peace</div>
<div class="line">And quiet and strength</div>
<div class="line">And renewal within the Causal Worlds</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">And whether found ascending in the East</div>
<div class="line">Or descending in the West</div>
<div class="line">The plane is without stress</div>

    <div class="date">2014-04-12</div>
    <div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">$13.34 earned by day labor</div>
<div class="line">$36.78 in all</div>
<div class="line">Which subtracted from the same feeling that I can stand aloof from betimes their winter quarters who have lost their vitality,</div>
<div class="line">And so frequently the most money demanded are never the worst vice betrayed</div>
<div class="line">Improvidence</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I sometimes dream of mine to ornament a line</div>
<div class="line">I cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation,</div>
<div class="line">Of a march of crusaders in the shallower parts,</div>
<div class="line">Floating up to feed, where else would they be?</div>
<div class="line">Some absolute goodness somewhere?</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">With such reminiscences I repeopled the woods</div>
<div class="line">And still from time to time</div>
<div class="line">Here are such that you have done great deeds and sung divine songs,</div>
<div class="line">Which shall still consist of only one or two of my pleasing works</div>
<div class="line">I took up my clothes, and along and out of the water,</div>
<div class="line">Full of glee and youth, as most suppose,</div>
<div class="line">Drained,</div>
<div class="line">Would not stand much about gracefulness,</div>
<div class="line">And never mean to countenance an effort,</div>
<div class="line">And never hesitated at a certain set of rules,</div>
<div class="line">Called etiquette and politeness,</div>
<div class="line">I made it worth the while</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">That economy of living is diminished in proportion to what we pay,</div>
<div class="line">Though there are any such, as has been gradually converted into the Middlesex hive,</div>
<div class="line">And that sometimes it was that man could not get on in the year take place only in youth,</div>
<div class="line">With round greasy face and paws,</div>
<div class="line">Wearing a thick new garment to take charge of a dollar,</div>
<div class="line">And having put on mourning in midsummer,</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">When I am convinced that I discovered</div>
<div class="line">That it should as surely as so many violent blows without being domesticated,</div>
<div class="line">Come floating up to feed,</div>
<div class="line">And the fact that the remedy <em>is</em> worse than the cure,</div>
<div class="line">The blue angels in it,</div>
<div class="line">As the railroad, six feet square by seven deep,</div>
<div class="line">Black melancholy in thought and in November,</div>
<div class="line">Usually in a grass hut,</div>
<div class="line">Listening to the last wrinkle which study had made,</div>
<div class="line">And growing five or six feet beneath the rattling teams and chaises</div>
<div class="line">And tinkling sleighs that travel the ice, seen near at home,</div>
<div class="line">I was plowing</div>
<div class="line">They warned me twice</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Once while I just let time wear on leaning against a low-land degeneracy,</div>
<div class="line">Thinking how little this village does for its own conditions,</div>
<div class="line">Changes, perhaps, from half an hour under a rotten stump,</div>
<div class="line">My hoe played the <em>Ranz des Vaches</em> ,</div>
<div class="line">A rich and various crop unreaped by man</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Mine was as it is</div>
<div class="line">Worse to have invented and established worship,</div>
<div class="line">Then to let them see they slew or captured any monster,</div>
<div class="line">Or finished any labor</div>
<div class="line">They have only one fact,</div>
<div class="line">Or the three I have for farm produce</div>
<div class="line">Sold at $23.44</div>

<div class="line">We are in the beginning of a lull</div>
<div class="line">And I have had an emotional experience</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Very calmly and very quietly I say</div>
<div class="line">All right</div>
<div class="line">Look at Gunsmoke</div>
<div class="line">Look at the proletariat</div>
<div class="line">The anarchy in production</div>
<div class="line">The crying inequalities in the modes of producing and appropriating products,</div>
<div class="line">That is bound to have an answer</div>
<div class="line">Get a Bible</div>
<div class="line">Get others</div>
<div class="line">Get the money</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">That is the bourgeoisie</div>
<div class="line">Use their life</div>
<div class="line">Take their time and labor</div>
<div class="line">They smash to pieces machinery</div>
<div class="line">They set factories ablaze</div>
<div class="line">They seek to alter the character of production</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Therefore as the people who profess one thing</div>
<div class="line">One social thing</div>
<div class="line">We go</div>
<div class="line">Because we take the name of God at the foot of the old property relations</div>
<div class="line">Not justified by faith</div>
<div class="line">But cooking with gas now</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I say that's great</div>
<div class="line">I say that's great</div>
<div class="line">I say, Lady, if it's carried out in your place</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Dissolution going on before our television sets</div>
<div class="line">Spending our time filling the night before</div>
<div class="line">I saw an inscription coming up this mountain</div>
<div class="line">To the unknown God</div>
<div class="line">Do You believe in Christ?</div>
<div class="line">Have you really given yourself to Christ?</div>
<div class="line">Do You believe in Him?</div>
<div class="line">I can do!</div>
<div class="line">See Romans 6:20-23</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">We take His name</div>
<div class="line">We write it down</div>
<div class="line">The Manifesto has become fully developed</div>
<div class="line">A new life of the state of society</div>
<div class="line">Minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">And the heroes of modern American life?</div>
<div class="line">Learn more by watching than by reading</div>
<div class="line">Why do you know what living was?</div>
<div class="line">I follow God and that place where the workers begin to form combinations</div>
<div class="line">Trades' Unions</div>
<div class="line">Against the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a nuclear war</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">That could be a revolution</div>
<div class="line">On the floor of the Law</div>
<div class="line">Administrative reforms based on class antagonisms be damned!</div>
<div class="line">No flesh be justified!</div>
