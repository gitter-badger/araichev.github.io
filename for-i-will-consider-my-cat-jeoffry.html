<h1>For I will consider my cat Jeoffry...</h1>
<div class="date">2012-04-24</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.</div>
<div class="line">For he is the servant of the Living God duly and daily serving him.</div>
<div class="line">For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his way.</div>
<div class="line">For this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness.</div>
<div class="line">For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his prayer.</div>
<div class="line">For he rolls upon prank to work it in.</div>
<div class="line">For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself.</div>
<div class="line">For this he performs in ten degrees.</div>
<div class="line">For first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are clean.</div>
<div class="line">For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.</div>
<div class="line">For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws extended.</div>
<div class="line">For fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.</div>
<div class="line">For fifthly he washes himself.</div>
<div class="line">For sixthly he rolls upon wash.</div>
<div class="line">For seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon the beat.</div>
<div class="line">For eighthly he rubs himself against a post.</div>
<div class="line">For ninthly he looks up for his instructions.</div>
<div class="line">For tenthly he goes in quest of food.</div>
<div class="line">For having consider’d God and himself he will consider his neighbour.</div>
<div class="line">For if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness.</div>
<div class="line">For when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a chance.</div>
<div class="line">For one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying.</div>
<div class="line">For when his day’s work is done his business more properly begins.</div>
<div class="line">For he keeps the Lord’s watch in the night against the adversary.</div>
<div class="line">For he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes.</div>
<div class="line">For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life.</div>
<div class="line">For in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him.</div>
<div class="line">For he is of the tribe of Tiger.</div>
<div class="line">For the Cherub Cat is a term of the Angel Tiger.</div>
<div class="line">For he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent, which in goodness he suppresses.</div>
<div class="line">For he will not do destruction, if he is well-fed, neither will he spit without provocation.</div>
<div class="line">For he purrs in thankfulness, when God tells him he’s a good Cat.</div>
<div class="line">For he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon.</div>
<div class="line">For every house is incomplete without him and a blessing is lacking in the spirit.</div>
<div class="line">For the Lord commanded Moses concerning the cats at the departure of the Children of Israel from Egypt.</div>
<div class="line">For every family had one cat at least in the bag.</div>
<div class="line">For the English Cats are the best in Europe.</div>
<div class="line">For he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped.</div>
<div class="line">For the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of God to him exceedingly.</div>
<div class="line">For he is the quickest to his mark of any creature.</div>
<div class="line">For he is tenacious of his point.</div>
<div class="line">For he is a mixture of gravity and waggery.</div>
<div class="line">For he knows that God is his Saviour.</div>
<div class="line">For there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest.</div>
<div class="line">For there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion.</div>
<div class="line">For he is of the Lord’s poor and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetually—Poor Jeoffry! poor Jeoffry! the rat has bit thy throat.</div>
<div class="line">For I bless the name of the Lord Jesus that Jeoffry is better.</div>
<div class="line">For the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete cat.</div>
<div class="line">For his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in music.</div>
<div class="line">For he is docile and can learn certain things.</div>
<div class="line">For he can set up with gravity which is patience upon approbation.</div>
<div class="line">For he can fetch and carry, which is patience in employment.</div>
<div class="line">For he can jump over a stick which is patience upon proof positive.</div>
<div class="line">For he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command.</div>
<div class="line">For he can jump from an eminence into his master’s bosom.</div>
<div class="line">For he can catch the cork and toss it again.</div>
<div class="line">For he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.</div>
<div class="line">For the former is afraid of detection.</div>
<div class="line">For the latter refuses the charge.</div>
<div class="line">For he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.</div>
<div class="line">For he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.</div>
<div class="line">For he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.</div>
<div class="line">For he killed the Ichneumon-rat very pernicious by land.</div>
<div class="line">For his ears are so acute that they sting again.</div>
<div class="line">For from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.</div>
<div class="line">For by stroking of him I have found out electricity.</div>
<div class="line">For I perceived God’s light about him both wax and fire.</div>
<div class="line">For the Electrical fire is the spiritual substance, which God sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast.</div>
<div class="line">For God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.</div>
<div class="line">For, tho he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.</div>
<div class="line">For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadruped.</div>
<div class="line">For he can tread to all the measures upon the music.</div>
<div class="line">For he can swim for life.</div>
<div class="line">For he can creep.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
