<li>We sail within a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end. When we think to attach ourselves to any point and to fasten to it, it wavers and leaves us; and if we follow it, it eludes our grasp, slips past us, and vanishes for ever.

~ Albert Einstein</li>
<li>Everyone must have two pockets, so that he can reach into the one or the other, according to his needs. In his right pocket are to be the words: 'For my sake was the world created,' and in his left: 'I am dust and ashes.'
~ Hasidic Saying</li>
<li>We have been told for years to bow down to 'the market.' We have placed our faith in the laws of supply and demand.  What has been forgotten, or ignored, is that the market rewards only efficiency. Every other human value gets in its way.
~ Eric Schlosser</li>
<li>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
~ Henry David Thoreau</li>
<li>I had that trapped feeling like some sort of poor insect that you've put inside a downturned glass, and it tries to climb up the sides, and it can't, and it can't, and it can't.
~ Cornell Woolrich on realizing his own mortality as a youth</li>
<li>If you really want something in life you have to work for it.  Now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers.
~ Homer Simpson, The Simpsons</li>
<li>I have also learned why people work so hard to succeed: It is because they envy the things their neighbors have. But it is useless. It is like chasing the wind... It is better to have only a little, with peace of mind, than be busy all the time with both hands, trying to catch the wind.
~ Ecclesiastes 4:4</li>
<li>Napoleon envied Caesar, Caesar envied Alexander, and Alexander, I daresay, envied Hercules, who never existed. You cannot, therefore, get away from envy by means of success alone, for there will always be in history or legend some person even more successful than you are.
~ Bertrand Russel</li>
<li>Grown-ups never understand anything for themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.
~ from The Little Prince by Antoine De Saint-Exupery</li>
<li>We are continuously bombarded with information, appeals, deadlines, communications... We are continually being squeezed or projected into the future as our present moments are assaulted and consumed in the fires of endless urgency.
~ Jon Kabat-Zinn</li>
<li>Today like every other day / We wake up empty and scared. / Don't open the door of your study / And begin reading. / Take down a musical instrument. / Let the beauty we love be what we do. / There are hundreds of ways to kneel / And kiss the earth.
~ Rumi</li>
<li>With the departure from this strange world, he now has gone a little ahead of me.  This is of no significance.  For us believing physicists, the separation between past, present, and future has only the meaning of an illusion, albeit a tenacious one.
~ Albert Einstein upon hearing of the death of his close friend Michelangelo Besso</li>
<li>Consume my heart away; sick with desire / And fastened to a dying animal / It knows not what it is...
~ William Butler Yeats from 'Sailing to Byzantium'</li>
<li>What nature requires is obtainable, and within easy reach. It's for the superfluous we sweat.
~ Seneca</li>
<li>The seat of the soul is where the inner world and the outer world meet. Where they overlap, it is in every point of the overlap.
~ Novalis</li>
<li>Old pond / frog jumps in—/ splash!
~ Basho</li>
<li>Deep in the mountains, the great temple bell is struck. You hear it reverberating in the morning air, and all thoughts disappear from your mind. There is nothing that is you; there is nothing that is not you. There is only the sound of the bell, filling the whole universe.
~ Seung Sahn</li>
<li>The Master does his job / and then stops. / He understands that the universe / is forever out of control, / and that trying to dominate events / goes against the current of the Tao.
~ Lao-Tzu</li>
<li>He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.
~ Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
<li>The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.
~ Henry David Thoreau</li>
<li>Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me and I am thankful. For the first time in my life everything is absolutely perfect the way it is. So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is and I won't ask for anything more. If that is OK, please give me absolutely no sign. [pause] OK, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, please give me no sign. [pause] Thy will be done. [eats food].
~ Bart Simpson, The Simpsons</li>
<li>All the greatest things we know have come to us from neurotics. It is they and they only who have founded religions and created great works of art. Never will the world be conscious of how much it owes to them, nor above all of what they have suffered in order to bestow their gifts on it.
~ Marcel Proust</li>
<li>All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened and after you are finished reading one you will feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it all belongs to you; the good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse and sorrow, the people and the places and how the weather was.
~ Ernest Hemingway</li>
<li>I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.
~ J. Robert Oppenheimer on the explosion of the first atomic bomb in New Mexico 16 July 1945</li>
<li>More than any other time in history, mankind faces a crossroads. One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness. The other, to total extinction. Let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly.
~ Woody Allen</li>
<li>If you want to find the meaning, stop chasing so many things.
~ Ryokan</li>
<li>Always looking away to the future.  Never your mind on where you are, hm?, on what you are doing?
~ Yoda J.M.</li>
<li>Such is the nature of men, that howsoever they may acknowledge many others to be more witty, or more eloquent, or more learned; yet they will hardly believe there be many so wise as themselves.
~ Thomas Hobbes</li>
<li>What is to give light must endure burning.
~ Viktor Frankl</li>
<li>The human understanding is not composed of dry light, but is subject to influence from the will and the emotions, a fact that creates a fanciful knowledge; man prefers to believe what he wants to be true.
~ Francis Bacon</li>
<li>There are, it seems, two Muses: the Muse of Inspiration, who gives us inarticulate visions and desires, and the Muse of Realization, who returns again and again to say, 'It is yet more difficult than you thought.'
~ Wendell Berry</li>
<li>In man this art of simulation reaches its peak: here deception, flattering, lying and cheating, talking behind the back, posing, living in borrowed splendor, being masked, the disguise of convention, acting a role before others and before oneself—in short, the constant fluttering around the single flame of vanity is so much the rule and the law that almost nothing is more incomprehensible than how an honest and pure urge for truth could make its appearance among men.
~ Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
<li>After the human mind has once despaired of finding truth, everything becomes very much feebler; and the result is that they turn men aside to agreeable discussions and discourses, and a kind of ambling around things, rather than sustain them in the severe path of inquiry.
~ Francis Bacon</li>
<li>There may be rhetoric about the socially constructed nature of Western science, but wherever it matters, there is no alternative.  There are no specifically Hindu or Taoist designs for mobile phones, faxes or televisions.  There are no satellites based on feminist alternatives to quantum theory.  Even that great public sceptic about the value of science, Prince Charles, never flies a helicopter burning homeopathically diluted petrol, that is, water with only a memory of benzine molecules, maintained by a schedule derived from reading tea leaves, and navigated by a crystal ball.
~ Simon Blackburn</li>
<li>The Angel that presided o'er my birth / Said, 'Little creature, formed of joy and mirth, / Go love without the help of any thing on earth.'&lt;br&gt;Love seeketh only Self to please, / To bind another to Its delight: / Joys in another's loss of ease, / And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite.&lt;br&gt;
~ William Blake</li>
<li>The human mind was designed by evolution to deal with foraging in small bands on the African savannah... faulting our minds for succumbing to games of chance is like complaining that our wrists are poorly designed for getting out of handcuffs.
~ Steven Pinker</li>
<li>Doubt is the vestibule which all must pass before they can enter the temple of wisdom. When we are in doubt and puzzle out the truth by our own exertions, we have gained something that will stay by us and will serve us again. But if to avoid the trouble of the search we avail ourselves of the superior information of a friend, such knowledge will not remain with us; we have not bought, but borrowed it.
~ Charles Caleb Colton</li>
<li>Although the Warrior's life is dedicated to helping others, he realizes that he will never be able to completely share his experience with others. The fullness of his experience is his own, and he must live with his own truth. Yet he is more and more in love with the world. That combination of love affair and loneliness is what enables the Warrior to constantly reach out to help others. By renouncing his private world, the Warrior discovers a greater universe and a fuller and fuller broken heart.
~ Chogyam Trungpa</li>
<li>I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we are reading doesn't wake us up with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for? ...we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.
~ Franz Kafka</li>
<li>It ain't so much the things we don't know that get us into trouble. It's the things we know that just ain't so.
~ Artemus Ward</li>
<li>You can't make somebody understand something if their salary depends upon them not understanding it.
~ Upton Sinclair</li>
<li>[We] all need to agree to live by the principles of rational discourse.  That, and common courtesy, is the only rule we need—just as in science.  As long as those who are believers will acknowledge that their allegiance gives them no privilege, no direct line to the absolute truth, no advantage in moral insight, we [brights and supers] should be able to get along just fine.
~ Daniel C. Dennett</li>
<li>For one human being to love another: that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation.
~ Rainer Maria Rilke</li>
<li>The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes.
~ Marcel Proust</li>
<li>Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky.
~ Rainer Maria Rilke</li>
<li>If people just wanted to be happy, it wouldn't be so hard, but they want to be happier than others—and that is almost always difficult because we imagine others to be happier than they really are.
~ Michel De Montaigne</li>
<li>Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.
~ Rainer Maria Rilke</li>
<li>I wish nothing else but to speak simply / please grant me this privelage / because we have burdened our song with so much music / that it is slowly sinking / and our art has become so ornate / that the makeup has corroded her face / and it is time to say our few simple words / because tomorrow our soul sails away
~ Giorgos Seferis</li>
<li>When the last living thing / has died on account of us, / how poetical it would be / if Earth could say, / in a voice floating up / perhaps / from the floor of the Grand Canyon, / 'It is done.' / People did not like it here.
~ Kurt Vonnegut</li>
<li>About the gods I have no means of knowing either that they exist or that they do not exist or what they are to look at. Many things prevent my knowing. Among others, the fact that they are never seen.
~ Protagoras</li>
<li>There is an universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like themselves, and to transfer to every object, those qualities, with which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately conscious. We find human faces in the moon, armies in the clouds; and by a natural propensity, if not corrected by experience and reflection, ascribe malice or good-willl to every thing, that hurts or pleases us.
~ David Hume</li>
<li>The human understanding, from its peculiar nature, easily supposes a greater degree of order and equality in things than it really finds; and although many things in nature be sui generis, and most irregular, will yet invent parallels and conjugates, and relatives where no such thing is.
~ Francis Bacon, Novum Organum</li>
<li>What ails the truth is that it is mainly uncomfortable, and often dull. The human mind seeks something more amusing, and more caressing.
~ H. L. Mencken</li>
<li>My opinion, my conviction, gains infinitely in strength and success the minute a second mind has adopted it.
~ Novalis</li>
<li>Two elderly women are at a Catskills mountain resort and one of them says, 'Boy, the food at this place is really terrible.' The other one says, 'I know, and such small portions.'
~ Woody Allen, Annie Hall</li>
<li>The real purpose of the scientific method is to make sure Nature hasn't mislead you into thinking you know something you don't actually know.
~ Robert Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</li>
<li>An awareness of how and when to question and a recognition of what it takes to truly know something are among the most important elements of what constitutes an educated person.
~ Thomas Gilovich, How We Know What Isn't So</li>
<li>All superstition is much the same, whether it be that of astrology, dreams, omens, retributive judgment, or the like, in all of which the deluded believers observe events which are fulfilled, but neglect and pass over their failure, though it be much more common.
~ Francis Bacon, Novum Organum</li>
<li>If the human economy is to be fitted into the natural economy in such a way that both may thrive, the human economy must be built to proper scale. It is possible to talk at great length about the difference between proper and improper scale. It may be enough to say here that that difference is suggested by the difference between amplified and unamplified music in the countryside, or the difference between the sound of a motorboat and the sound of oarlocks. A proper human sound, we may say, is one that allows other sounds to be heard. A properly scaled human economy or technology allows a diversity of other creatures to thrive.
~ Wendell Berry</li>
<li>In fact we are not in possession of our faculties; we are possessed by them. We do not really think; we are thought.
~ Robert Linssen, Living Zen</li>
<li>The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life, seems to arise from over-rating the difference between one permanent situation and another...Some of those situations may, no doubt, deserve to be preferred to others: but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardour which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice; or to corrupt the future tranquillity of our minds, either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly, or by remorse from the horror of our own injustice.
~ Adam Smith, The Theory of the Moral Sentiments</li>
<li>I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.
~ Mark Twain</li>
<li>Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man.
~ Francis Bacon, Essays, Of Studies</li>
<li>We would rather be ruined than changed, / We would rather die in our dread / Than climb the cross of the moment / And let our illusions die.
~ W. H. Auden, The Age of Anxiety, line 407</li>
<li>Hello, babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. At the outside, babies, you've got about a hundred years here. There's only one rule that I know of, babies 'God damn it, you've got to be kind.'
~ Kurt Vonnegut, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater</li>
<li>The main thing a musician would like to do is to give a picture to the listener of the many wonderful things he knows of and senses in the universe.
~ John Coltrane, liner notes to Crescent</li>
<li>Once upon a time a man whose ax was missing suspected his neighbor's son. The boy walked like a thief, looked like a thief, and spoke like a thief. But the man found his ax while digging in the valley, and the next time he saw his neighbor's son, the boy walked, looked and spoke like any other child.
~ Lao Tzu</li>
<li>Restrictions and inadequacies usually come from feeling burdened, as though we are carrying a heavy load. But if we develop the notion of space fully and properly, we begin to find that there is no burden, no load. That is a relief—not just a petty relief, but a larger version of mind altogether. We begin to realize that an extraordinary openness takes place in our lives
~ Chogyam Trungpa</li>
<li>We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world.
~ Marcel Proust</li>
<li>Americans find prosperity almost everywhere, but not happiness. For them desire for wellbeing has become a restless burning passion which increases with satisfaction. To start with emigration was a necessity for them: now it is a sort of gamble, and they enjoy the sensations as much as the profit.
~ Alexis De Tocqueville, Democracy in America</li>
<li>Selfish behaviors are reward driven and innate, wired deeply into the survival mechanisms of the primitive brain, and when consistently reinforced, they will run away to greed, with its associated craving for money, food, or power. On the other hand, the self restraint and the empathy for others that are so important in fostering physical and mental health are learned behaviors—largely functions of the new human cortex and thus culturally dependent. These social behaviors are fragile and learned by imitations much as we learn language.
~ Peter Whybrow, American Mania</li>
<li>Most of these people in the nations of the United States are extremely eager in the pursuit of immediate material pleasures and are always discontented with the position they occupy. They think about nothing but ways of changing their lot and bettering it... An American will build a house in which to pass his old age and sell it before the roof is on. He will plant a garden and rent it just as the trees are coming into bear. He will take up a profession and leave it, settle in one place and soon go off elsewhere with his changing desire. Yet at the end of the year crammed with work he has little spare leisure. His restless curiosity goes with him traveling up and down the vast territories of the United States.
~ Alexis De Tocqueville, Democracy in America</li>
<li>They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones.
~ George Orwell, 1984</li>
<li>Meditation is not a matter of trying to achieve ecstasy, spiritual bliss or tranquility, nor is it attempting to become a better person. It is simply the creation of space in which we are able to expose and undo neurotic games, our self deception, our hidden hopes and fears.
~ Chogyam Trungpa</li>
<li>As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.
~ Henry David Thoreau</li>
<li>A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, 'Universe', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest—a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.
~ Albert Einstein</li>
<li>[Our] normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different. We may go through life without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their completeness, definite types of mentality which probably somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No account of the universe in its totality can be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded. How to regard them is the question—for they are so discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and they open a region though they fail to give a map. At any rate, they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality.
~ William James</li>
<li>Where the world ceases to be the scene of our personal hopes and wishes, where we face it as free beings admiring, asking and observing, there we enter the realm of Art and Science.
~ Albert Einstein</li>
<li>These our actors, / As I foretold you, were all spirits, and / Are melted into air, into thin air, / And, like the baseless fabric of vision, / The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, / The solemn temples, the great globe itself, / Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve / And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, / Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff / As dreams are made on, and our little life / Is rounded with sleep.
~ William Shakespeare, The Tempest, 4.1</li>
<li>What man most passionately wants is his living wholeness and his living unison, not his own isolate salvation of his 'soul'. Man wants his physical fulfillment first and foremost, since now, once and once only, he is in the flesh and potent. For man, the vast marvel is to be alive. For man, as for flower and beast and bird, the supreme triumph is to be most vividly, most perfectly alive. Whatever the unborn and the dead may know, they cannot know the beauty, the marvel of being alive in the flesh. The dead may look after the afterwards. But the magnificent here and now of life in the flesh is ours, and ours alone, and ours only for a time. We ought to dance with rapture that we should be alive and in the flesh, and part of the living, incarnate cosmos. I am part of the sun as my eye is part of me. That I am part of the earth my feet know perfectly, and my blood is part of the sea. My soul knows that I am part of the human race, my soul is an organic part of the great human soul, as my spirit is part of my nation. In my own very self, I am part of my family. There is nothing of me that is alone and absolute except my mind, and we shall find that the mind has no existence by itself, it is only the glitter of the sun on the surface of the waters.
~ D. H. Lawrence, Apocalypse</li>
<li>They all talked at once, their voices insistent and contradictory and impatient, making of unreality a possibility, then a probability, then an incontrovertible fact, as people will when their desires become words.
~ William Faulkner, Sound and Fury</li>
<li>The thought manifests as the word. The word manifests as the deed. The deed develops into habit. And habit hardens into character. So watch the thought and its ways with care, and let it spring from love born out of concern for all beings... As the shadow follows the body, as we think, so we become.
~ Siddhattha Gotama Buddha, c. 500 BCE</li>
<li>'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?' By real magic, people mean miracles, thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers. 'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.' Real magic, in other words, refers to the magic that is not real, while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic.
~ Lee Siegel</li>
<li>A mountain climber foolishly climbing alone slips off a precipice and finds himself dangling at the end of his safety rope, a thousand feet above a ravine. Unable to climb the rope or swing to a safe resting spot, he calls out in despair. 'Hallooo, hallooo! Can anybody help me?' To his astonishment, the clouds part, a beautiful light pours through them, and a mighty voice replies, 'Yes, my son, I can help you. Take your knife and cut the rope!' The climber takes out his knife, and then he stops, and thinks and thinks. Then he cries out: 'Can anybody else help me?'
~ folklore, phrasing by Daniel Dennett in Breaking the Spell, 2006</li>
<li>[A friend of mine] was present at a high-powered ethics institute which had put on a forum in which representatives of the great religions held a panel debate. First the Buddhist talked of the ways to calm, the mastery of desire, the path of enlightenment, and the panellists all said 'Wow, terrific, if that works for you that’s great.' Then the Hindu talked of the cycles of suffering and birth and rebirth, the teachings of Krishna and the way to release, and they all said 'Wow, terrific, if that works for you that’s great.' And so on, until the Catholic priest talked of the message of Jesus Christ, the promise of salvation and the way to life eternal, and they all said 'Wow, terrific, if that works for you that’s great.' And he thumped the table and shouted: 'No! It’s not a question of it if works for me! It’s the true word of the living God, and if you don’t believe it you’re all damned to Hell!' And they all said: 'Wow, terrific, if that works for you that’s great.'
~ Simon Blackburn in Ethics: A Very Short Introduction, 2001</li>
<li>The day finally dawns where the definitive moment of being here, right now, conclusively arrives; something irrevocable takes place and every thing and every body and every event is different, somehow, although the same physically; something immutable occurs and every thing and every body and every event is all-of-a-sudden undeniably actual, in and of itself, as a fact; something irreversible happens and an immaculate perfection and a pristine purity permeates every thing and every body and every event; something has changed forever, although it is as if nothing has happened, except that the entire world is a magical fairytale-like playground full of incredible gladness and a delight which is never-ending.
~ Richard from the Actual Freedom Trust</li>
<li>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
~ Theodore Roosevelt, 1910</li>
<li>Don’t wander, don’t wander, place mindfulness on guard; / Along the road of distraction, Mara lies in ambush. / Mara is the mind, clinging to like and dislike, / So look into the essence of this magic, free from dualistic fixation. / Realize that your mind is unfabricated primordial purity; / There is no Buddha elsewhere, look at your own face; / There is nothing else to search for, rest in your own place; / Non-meditation is spontaneous perfection so capture the royal seat.
~ Vajra song of the First Tsoknyi Rinpoche, early 1800s</li>
<li>My body is like a phantom, like bubbles on a stream. My mind, looking into itself, is as formless as empty-space, yet somewhere within sounds are perceived. Who is hearing?
~ Bassui Tokushō, circa 1350</li>
<li>Try to be mindful, and let things take their natural course. Then your mind will become still in any surroundings, like a clear forest pool. All kinds of wonderful, rare animals will come to drink at the pool, and you will clearly see the nature of all things. You will see many strange and wonderful things come and go, but you will be still. This is the happiness of the Buddha.
~ Ajahn Chah, circa 1970</li>
<li>The method of science is the method of bold conjectures and ingenious and severe attempts to refute them.
~ Karl Popper, 1972</li>
<li>In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what would be implied if this law that we guessed is right. Then we compare the result of the computation to nature, with experiment or experience, compare it directly with observation, to see if it works. If it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It does not make any difference how beautiful your guess is. It does not make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is — if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. That is all there is to it... It is true that one has to check a little to make sure that it is wrong, because whoever did the experiment may have reported incorrectly, or there may have been some feature in the experiment that was not noticed, some dirt or something; or the man who computed the consequences, even though it may have been the one who made the guesses, could have made some mistake in the analysis. These are obvious remarks, so when I say if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong, I mean after the experiment has been checked, the calculations have been checked, and the thing has been rubbed back and forth a few times to make sure that the consequences are logical consequences from the guess, and that in fact it disagrees with a very carefully checked experiment.
~ Richard Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, 1965</li>
<li>If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?
~ Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956</li>
<li>I recommend almost dying to everybody. It's character building. You get a much clearer perspective of what's important and what isn't, the preciousness and beauty of life.
~ Carl Sagan</li>
<li>Illness is the most heeded of doctors. To goodness and wisdom we make only promises; pain we obey.
~ Marcel Proust</li>
<li>As to me, I know of nothing else but miracles.
~ Walt Whitman, Miracles, Leaves of Grass, 1900</li>
<li>I like to use what I call my bathroom metaphor. If two people live in an apartment and there are two bathrooms, then both have freedom of the bathroom. You can go to the bathroom anytime you want to stay as long as you want for whatever you need. And everyone believes in freedom of the bathroom. It should be right there in the Constitution. But if you have twenty people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up times for each person, you have to bang on the door, 'Aren’t you through yet?' and so on.  In the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it. As you put more and more people onto the world, the value of life not only declines, it disappears. It doesn’t matter if someone dies. The more people there are, the less one person matters.
~ Isaac Asimov, interview with Bill Moyers, 1989</li>
<li>Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.
~ Aldous Huxley, Proper Studies, 1927</li>
<li>Bāhiya, you should train yourself thus: In reference to the seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard. In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to the cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself. When for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to the sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, Bāhiya, there is no you in connection with that. When there is no you in connection with that, there is no you there. When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, just this, is the end of stress.
~ Siddhattha Gotama Buddha, Udana 1.10, c. 500 BCE</li>
<li>To God all things are fair and good and just, but people hold some things wrong and some right.
~ Heraclitus, c. 500 BCE</li>
<li>Life is short, the craft long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment difficult.
~ Hippocrates, c. 400 BCE</li>
<li>The purpose of meditation is personal transformation. The you that goes in one side of the meditation experience is not the same you that comes out the other side. It changes your character by a process of sensitization, by making you deeply aware of your own thoughts, word, and deeds. Your arrogance evaporates and your antagonism dries up. Your mind becomes still and calm. And your life smoothes out. Thus meditation properly performed prepares you to meet the ups and down of existence. It reduces your tension, your fear, and your worry. Restlessness recedes and passion moderates. Things begin to fall into place and your life becomes a glide instead of a struggle. All of this happens through understanding.
~ Henepola Gunaratana, Mindfulness in Plain English, 1991</li>
<li>Creatures of a day, what is anyone? What are they not? We are but a dream of a shadow. Yet when there comes as a gift of heaven a gleam of sunshine, there rests upon the heart a radiant light and, aye, a gentle life.
~ Pindar, 518–438 BCE</li>
<li>The thought 'who am I?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the funeral pyre, it will itself be burnt up in the end. Then, there will be Self-realization. When other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them but should diligently inquire: 'To whom do they occur?' It does not matter how many thoughts arise. As each thought arises, one should inquire with alertness, 'To whom has this thought arisen?'' The answer that would emerge would be 'to me'. Thereupon if one inquires 'Who am I?'' the mind will go back to its source; and the thought that arose will subside. With repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the power to stay in its source.
~ Ramana Maharshi, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/who_am_I.pdf">Who Am I?</a>, 1902</li>
<li>The practice of meditation is not what is ordinarily meant by practice, in the sense of repetitious preparation for some future performance. It may seem odd and illogical to say that meditation, in the form of yoga, Dhyana, or Zazen, as used by Hindus and Buddhists, is a practice without purpose—in some future time—because it is the art of being completely centered in the here and now. Meditation is therefore the art of suspending verbal and symbolic thinking for a time, somewhat as a courteous audience will stop talking when a concert is about to begin. Simply sit down, close your eyes, and listen to all sounds that may be going on—without trying to name or identify them. Listen as you would listen to music. If you find that verbal thinking will not drop away, don’t attempt to stop it by force of will-power. Just keep your tongue relaxed, floating easily in the lower jaw, and listen to your thoughts as if they were birds chattering outside—mere noise in the skull—and they will eventually subside of themselves, as a turbulent and muddy pool will become calm and clear if left alone.
~ Allan Watts, <em>Way of &nbsp;Liberation</em>, p. 91–95</li>
